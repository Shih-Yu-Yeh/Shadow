# Shadow
Based on advanced language model technology, an AI administrator has been developed that can manage Redmine completely autonomously. It can automatically handle various requirements raised by users, while detecting system status, daily backup issues, and automatically repairing Redmine exceptions.



Just imagine, once this project progresses, Shadow can perfectly and completely take over the Redmine system without human intervention. Then, it can be reasonably speculated that the following scenario will occur:

When Shadow fully masters the NAS, he can become a NAS administrator.
When Shadow fully masters GITLAB, he can be a Gitlab administrator.
When Shadow fully masters JIRA, he can become a Jira administrator.
When Shadow has complete control over the company's NETWORK, he can serve as the company's network expert.
When Shadow fully masters the BANK'S CORE SYSTEM, he can speed up the account opening process and self-detect abnormal accounts, provide early warning and dynamically manage the resources required by the system to avoid abnormal situations.
